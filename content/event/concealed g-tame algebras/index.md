abstract: 'The $\mathbf{g}$-vector fan is a convex-geometric construction to study the $\tau$-tilting theory of an algebra. Using it one extends the notions of tame representation type to $\tau$-tilting theory, by saying that an algebra is $\mathbf{g}$-tame if its $\mathbf{g}$-vector fan is dense in $\mathbb R^n$.
\\
Tame algebras are always $\mathbf{g}$-tame, but the converse is not true in general.
\\
In this talk we show that concealed algebras are $\mathbf{g}$-tame if and only if they are tame. This also implies the same result for incidence algebras of simply connected posets.
