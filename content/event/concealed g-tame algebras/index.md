abstract: 'The g-vector fan is a convex-geometric construction to study the τ-tilting theory of an algebra. Using it one extends the notions of tame representation type to τ-tilting theory, by saying that an algebra is g-tame if its g-vector fan is dense in ℝ^n.
\\
Tame algebras are always g-tame, but the converse is not true in general.
\\
In this talk we show that concealed algebras are g-tame if and only if they are tame. This also implies the same result for incidence algebras of simply connected posets.
