summary: Derived representation type and G-equivariant spectra
abstract: 'The problem of classifying indecomposable representations is one of the earliest problems in representation theory. The famous Tame-Wild dichotomy loosely says that algebras split into two groups: those where classifying modules are relatively easily, and those where a classification is completely hopeless. In 2003 a similar dichotomy was proven for perfect complexes in the derived category.
\\
There is a close relationship between the homotopy category of G-equivariant spectra and the derived category of cohomological MacKey functors. In this talk we look at which groups give rise to derived tame and which give rise to derived wild cohomological MacKey functors.
